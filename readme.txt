Electric mobility plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has surged in recent years, the limited availability of charging infrastructure poses a significant challenge. This project leverages geospatial data and visualization techniques to analyze the demand for additional electric charging stations in Berlin.

By integrating and analyzing diverse datasets related to Berlin's urban landscape, traffic patterns, and existing infrastructure, we aim to provide actionable insights for optimizing the placement of new charging stations.

Key Features:

1) Analysis of geospatial datasets for Berlin.
2) Identification of high-demand areas for electric charging infrastructure.
3) Use of advanced data visualization and mapping tools.
